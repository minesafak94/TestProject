Arrays in Java:
        Arrays allow us to store multiple values in a single variable. We use indexes to get back the values.

Why we should learn Arrays:
        If we have to store a lot of values, it becomes hard to manage that much of variables.

Syntax of Arrays:
        We can create arrays in two different ways:

First way:

        datatype[]name={element 1, element 2, element3}

        sout(name[0]);// output-> element 1

Second way:
        datatype [] name=new dataype [size];


NOTE:
Other tahn using loops , we can also use syntax below:

int [] arr={10,13,20,25,45,50};
// this command just for viewing all input from an array without a loop
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
