2D Arrays:

    Are arrays that contain 1D arrays.

Why we should learn about 2D arrays.
    Because they allow us to store multiple one d arrays which gives us more flexibility to store data.
    for example if we have to store data from excel files we can use 2D arrays.

Sntax to create 2D Arrays:

First way:
DataType [][] nameofArray = new DataType[SizeofRows][];

Second way:
DataType [][] nameofArray = {{data,data,data},{data,data,data,data},{data,data}};

OOPs is nothing but some set of rules that if we follow we achieve below
object oriented programming -oop
1) representing real life entities becomes easier
2) Code repetiition is minimized
3) Changing existing code becomes easier
4) helps write secure code
