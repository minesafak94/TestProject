When we should use String Class:
    when we want to save as much memory as possible, and we are okay if the programs get a little slow!

When should we use StringBuilder?
    when we want max.speed and we dont care how much memory our programs going to occupy.

What does it mean by String is immutable?
    It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer and the reason they are
    immutable is because same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if we allow any of the variable to change
    the value it can break the complete system.
