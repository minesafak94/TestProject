Methods in Java:

Is just a collection of java statements and block of code like if else loop println's etc.

Why would we learn about methods:

1)  It allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods
    for them build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.

2)  Methods allow us to re-use code.

3)  Methods allow us to be flexible (we can fix anything without problems)


How can we create Methods?

        -> There are 2 types of, built-in and user defined.


Build-in methods?

        ->The methods which are designed by Java developers for example the println() nextInt() method in the scanner class
        length () present in String class they are all built-in methods.

User defined Methods:
        ->The methods that we write.

Methods which return sth when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

int add(int a,int b){
return (a+b);//return is statement
}

int => return type of a method
add => name of th method
(int a,int b)=> parameters of the method or the inpur to the method
{=> body of method
}

Rules:
return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match

There are tree types of variables with respect to their scope
local variables:
        if variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop if condition etc.
        called local variables.
UPSIDE:
        Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always write coe, with help of local variable.

        //they are destroyed after executing, you cannot reuse it

DOWNSIDE:
        They cant be accessed outside the block in which they are ceated.They have very limited scope.

instance variables:
        all variables which are created inside a class outside of methods are called instance variables.
UPSIDE:
We can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local varialbes

DOWNSIDE:
        They stay longer in the momeory as compared to local variables.

Static variables:
        All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are calles static variables
