Operators:
            Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtraktion
            we can compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number
            or not.

            There are 3 three main types of operators. They are
            arithmetic operators,
            relational operators and
            logical operators.

Arithmetic operators:

            We use arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions, subtraction etc.
            + => Addition
            - => Subtraction
            / => Division
            * => Multiplication
            % => Modulus (to calculate the remainder)

Relational operators:

            Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example if sth is bigger than other
            thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
            == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false
            != => used to check if two variable don't contain the same value. We get a true, if they are not same.
            >  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true
            <  => used to check if one value is smaller than other value on the right side we will get a true
            >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true
            <= => it opposite of >= and it used to check if sth is less than or equal to other thing

Conditional constructs:

            Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true
            that java execute the code otherwise it skips that code.

            How to write IfElse conditions:
            if (condition) {
            any line of code even another if condition

            if() {
            }


            }

Important Notes:
            1) For String we use equals method instead of == sign because it's a non -primitive data type
            2) We can cmd+opt+l(Mac) to format our code
            3) If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

If Else conditions
            1)If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else If
            2)If I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
