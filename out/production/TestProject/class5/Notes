Logical Operators>
Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values. There are logical operators
! || &&

Why we should learn about the logical operators?
    we can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

What is the syntax?
    they only work with boolean data type
    if (! condition)
    if (condition1 || condition2)
    if (condition1 && condition2)

NOT Operator (!)
Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is true it will make it false if something is false it will be true

AND Operator (&&)

OR Operator (||)


What is a Switch Case statement:
Switch case statement are just another way of achieving the same results as if-else-if conditions


Why should we learn about them?
The reason we should use them is they are very fast.

Syntax:
String var:
    switch (var){
    case 1:
    sout"1";
    break;

}

 Rules that we should follow:
1) We can only use byte short int char String in switch case statements.
2) We cant use relational operators in switch case statements it s also not allowed
3) we cant use logical operators
