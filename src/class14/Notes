String class:
               String is the most widely used class in java. It can store sequence of characters.
               We should be using this class when we want  to save memory,
               and we are not planning to make a lot of modifications to the String values.

StringBuilder Class:

              String builder is exactly the same as String class but is changeable (mutable).
