Create a Set of cities in which you want to make sure that insertion order is maintained.
Then remove any city that starts with “A”;

Create a Set collection that will hold Objects of Student Type. In this set we do not care about the insertion order.
Each student object should have name and studentID. Display name of each student.



HashSet -> no insertion order, its alphabetic
LinkedSet-> retains insertion order
TreeSet->no order, int has order

LinkedHashSet-> insertion order is retained

LinkedHashSet<Integer>uniqueNumbers=new LinkedHashSet<>(num);//um die Liste hier einzufuegen
            System.out.println(uniqueNumbers);
        }
