Logical Operators:
        Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
        They only work with boolean variables. (true|false)
        There are three logical operators

        1) !
        2) ||
        3) &&

Why should we use logical Operators:
        1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
        2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.

NOT (!)
        it reverse the conditions, if sth is true it will make it false and if sth is false it will make it true
        System.out.println(!true)=> false

Logical Or Operator (||)
        It combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one condition is true.
        If all the conditions become false it returns us a false

Logical And Operator (&&)
